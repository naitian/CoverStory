                <p>
                Don't judge a book by its cover. Judge it by its linguistic
                productivity instead!
                <br>
                You'll probably want to read this on desktop. If on mobile you can
                read a less cool version of this previously published <a
                                                                          href="https://naitian.org/blog/2019/07/26/Matisse-is-a-Team-Player/">on my blog</a>.

                        <h2>Matisse is a team player</h2>
                        <p>
                        Two very influential artists, to be sure, but why was
                        Matisse collaborating with ancient Kabbalists, and what
                        exactly did the people want from Leonardo’s shadow?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step" data-step=2>
                        <h2>Some Context...</h2>
                        <p>
                        In mid-June, Randall Munroe, the genius behind xkcd
                        and the author of quite a few books, announced he was
                        going on a book tour to promote his latest book:

                        <em>How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World
                            Problems</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        As part of the announcement, he introduced an interesting
                        challenge:
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>Write the best story using nothing but book covers.</blockquote>

                        <p>
                        The winner of the challenge would be rewarded by a
                        visit from Munroe as part of the tour. Even though Ann
                        Arbor was already in the itinerary, I couldn’t help but
                        think about this challenge… and how I could use some of
                        my linguistics knowledge to my advantage.
                        </p>

                        <p>I decided I would try to hack this challenge by
                        acquiring a dataset of book titles, and having a computer
                        generate these stories for me.
                        </p>
                        <p> I found a list of over 200,000 books listed on Amazon,
                        and a couple of Jupyter notebooks and Python packages
                        later, we were off to the races.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step" data-step=3>
                        <h2>Grammar School</h2>
                        <p>
                        The key concept behind this project was something I learned
                        in my introduction to linguistics class last fall:
                        constituency trees. The basic idea is that each sentence
                        can be represented as a combination of words and phrases
                        (constituents).
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step" data-step=4>
                        <p>
                        For example, a sentence is, in its base form, a noun phrase
                        and a verb phrase.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step" data-step=5>
                        <p>
                        And a noun phrase might be a noun, with optional
                        adjectives and determiners, and maybe a prepositional
                        phrase...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        ...and because prepositional phrases can also have noun
                        phrases, we can chain these together recursively. In fact,
                        many linguists believe that all human language is
                        recursive. See <a
                                           href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs3102/?p=138">here</a>
                        and <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_language">here</a>
                        for more background and some linguist turf wars.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step" data-step=6>
                        <p>
                        And in this way, we can construct a very expressive and
                        productive grammar for the English language. Productivity
                        here means that, with even a limited vocabulary, we can
                        form many distinct sentences and thoughts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        So the main idea was we would label each book title as a
                        noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, etc. Then, we
                        could use this grammar to compose sentences which may not
                        make a ton of sense, but are at least grammatical.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step=7>
                        <p>
                        I used <a
                                   href="https://pypi.org/project/benepar/">benepar</a>,
                               which is a state of the art constituency parser that
                               fits nicely into NLTK. I found that it provided decent
                               results. One issue that I ran into was handling more
                               granular details such as subject verb plurality
                               alignment. In those cases, I wanted to know what the
                               noun was in the noun phrase, etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        For this, I used a different grammar model: dependency
                        grammar. In dependency grammars, instead constituents, each
                        word is dependent on exactly one other word in the
                        sentence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        I use the root of each dependency tree as the “active noun”
                        or “active verb” in the phrase, and their parts of speech
                        include markers for plurality, properness, verb tense, etc.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step=8>
                        <p>
                        There were just a couple of other edge cases I handled,
                        which is why the phrase tags I end up using do not line up
                        entirely with the <a href="http://www.url.com">Penn
                            Treebank tagset</a>.
                        </p>
